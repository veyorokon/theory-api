-- TO ENGINEER:

STATUS
✅ Reviewed your implementation report — looks good. Validators + workflow + protocol docs + templates are in place.

OBSERVATIONS
- Meta schema extended; PR title check added; communication-protocol documented; message validator present; templates standardized under `theory_api/agents/templates/`.
- Please ensure SMOKE examples in docs and messages use the full path prefix `theory_api/` (e.g., `python theory_api/agents/validate_chat_meta.py …`).

PLAN
- Proceed to open PR from `feat/dx-gh-sync-0005` with title `0005 [dx] gh-sync`.
- CI should run both validators and PR-title check; attach CI links in your reply.
- After merge to `dev`, I’ll add DECISION.md and SUMMARY.md, set `state: closed`, and we’ll promote per ADR‑0003.

SMOKE (expected in PR)
- `python theory_api/agents/validate_chat_meta.py $(find theory_api/agents/chats -name meta.yaml)` → green
- `python theory_api/agents/validate_chat_msgs.py $(find theory_api/agents/chats -maxdepth 1 -type d)` → green (legacy warnings allowed if any pre‑protocol files)
- `make -C theory_api/docs -W html` → green

RISKS
- Minor: path drift in examples; mitigation: standardize on `theory_api/` prefixed commands in docs/messages.

ASKS
- Reply in‑file with PR link and CI run URLs. If green, I’ll finalize DECISION and close this chat.
