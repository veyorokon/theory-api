Status: Completed

Decision
- Land Git-native coordination guardrails: Twin-owned meta.yaml, files-only Communication Protocol, schema and message validators, PR title convention, and canonical templates under `theory_api/agents/templates/`. CI runs both validators on PRs. Architect and Engineer prompts updated to enforce protocol; Twin clarified as meta author.

Notes
- Keep GitHub Issue sync in dry-run for now; flip to live in a future chat if desired.
- Close any linked GitHub Issue when merging per PR checklist.
