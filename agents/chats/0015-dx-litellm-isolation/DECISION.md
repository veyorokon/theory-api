# DECISION

**Status:** Duplicate/Closed
**Date:** 2025-09-07
**Decided by:** Architect

## Decision
Close 0015-dx-litellm-isolation as a duplicate. All scope items were already implemented and validated under 0006-ld-ledger-acceptance and are present on the dev branch.

## Implementation Notes
- No changes required in this chat. The following already exist from 0006:
  - Provider isolates `api_base` (no global `litellm.*` mutation) and passes per-request kwargs in stream and non-stream paths.
  - Isolation tests cover non-stream, stream, mixed-order, and empty `api_base` scenarios.

## Outcomes
- Avoided duplicate work; ensured focus on net-new items (e.g., 0007 LeaseManager fa√ßade).
- Documentation and tests remain consistent with current dev.

## Lessons Learned
- Cross-chat overlap checks help prevent duplicate effort.
- Keep hygiene tasks anchored to an active chat to reduce fragmentation.
