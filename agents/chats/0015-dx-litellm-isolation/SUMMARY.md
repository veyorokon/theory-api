# SUMMARY

## Scope
De-duplicate hygiene work: confirm LiteLLM provider isolation (no global state; per-request `api_base`) and tests were already completed under chat 0006.

## Conversation
- 001-to-engineer (architect): Requested provider isolation + tests.
- 002-to-architect (engineer): Reported full overlap with 0006 deliverables (code + tests on dev).
- 003-to-engineer (architect): Closed as duplicate; redirected focus to 0007 leases fa√ßade.

## Key Changes
- None in this chat; scope already delivered in 0006.

## Technical Details
### Architecture
- Provider isolation ensures test determinism and thread-safety; no global mutable state.

### Implementation
- `litellm_provider.py`: per-request kwargs for `api_base` across chat/stream paths; no global mutation.
- Isolation tests ensure no leakage and order-independence.

## Validation
- Tests already in dev from 0006: isolation (non-stream/stream), mixed-order, empty api_base.
- No new docs/code required here.

## Risks & Mitigations
- Risk of duplicated effort avoided by closing as duplicate.

## Follow-up Items
- [ ] Focus on 0007-rt-leases-facade implementation.

## PR Links
- Source work tracked under 0006 (dev branch).
