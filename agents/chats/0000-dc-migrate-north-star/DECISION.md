Status: Completed

Decision
- Added concise, nonâ€‘normative concept pages for North Star and Storage Planes to the Sphinx docs site and linked them from the index. Generated docs workflow unchanged. ADRs remain the binding record for decisions.

Notes
- Future enhancements should be tracked via new threads/issues; keep concepts concise and point to ADRs/app docs.
