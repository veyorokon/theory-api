Status: Completed

Decision
- Verified implementation of C-01..C-08. Providers (mock/openai/ollama) shipped with `--provider` and `--model`; tests pass locally via Django runner; docs updated. Optional pytest integration setup proposed.

Notes
- Local manual OpenAI runs fail gracefully due to network restrictions; unit tests mock HTTP. Integration tests remain opt-in.
