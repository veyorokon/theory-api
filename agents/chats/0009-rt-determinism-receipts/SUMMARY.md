# SUMMARY

## Scope
Determinism receipts: on successful execution settle, write a receipt under `/artifacts/execution/<id>/determinism.json` and include a `determinism_uri` pointer in the settle event payload; handle budget math atomically; emit memo-hit events.

## Conversation
- 001-to-engineer (architect): Initial spec with receipt bytes and settle helpers.
- 002-to-engineer (architect): Reconciled to repo reality (storage shim, LedgerWriter API, Execution model).
- 003-to-architect (engineer): Confirmed implementation; tests and docs green; PR opened.

## Key Changes
- Added runtime receipt writer and settlement helpers; storage shim to upload bytes.
- Used `LedgerWriter().append_event` for `execution.settle.success/failure` and `execution.memo_hit`.
- Tests cover receipt bytes, budget math, and event payloads.
- Docs export builds; no drift.

## Technical Details
### Architecture
- Receipts are immutable artifacts; ledger events point to receipts for audit.
- Budget math enforced with transactions; no new model fields.

### Implementation
- Compact JSON receipts; adapters used for upload.
- Event payloads use `event_type` and include refund/actual/estimate as integers.

## Validation
- Unit: determinism receipt bytes tests passing.
- Acceptance (PG): settlement + event pointer tests passing.
- Docs: `make docs` green.

## Risks & Mitigations
- Storage shim is minimal and delegates to existing adapters; safe.
- Events keep consistent payload shapes for later consumers.
