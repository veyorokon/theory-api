Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines programmed to think and learn like humans, enabling them to perform tasks such as problem-solving, decision-making, and language understanding. It encompasses various technologies, including machine learning, natural language processing, and robotics, which allow systems to analyze data, recognize patterns, and improve their performance over time.
